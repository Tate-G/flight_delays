Flight delay predictions available months in advance to improve US domestic flight itinerary booking. Users input basic flight characteristics known at the time of booking and receive transparent delay odds based on neural network modeling of past flights, along with the context to help interpret those odds.


The notebook Flight_Delay_Predictor demonstrates flight delay prediction based on a user-given flight itinerary. Training of the model used in the predictor is shown in Flight_Delay_Model_Training. Cross-validation and model evaluation are shown in Flight_Delay_Validation.
